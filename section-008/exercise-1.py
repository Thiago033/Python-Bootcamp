#You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

from math import ceil

def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    cans = ceil((height*width) / cover)
    print(f"You'll need {cans} cans of paint.")


test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
